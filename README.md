I am excited to share my recently completed portfolio website with you. Although I am not a professional designer, I took on the challenge of creating the UI design from scratch. I drew inspiration from various sources to create a visually appealing and unique design.

## The portfolio was built using the following technologies:

- React.js
- TailwindCSS
- Framer-Motion
- Figma (for UI design)

## Getting Started
